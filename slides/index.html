# Making and HTTP Server in Fennel! (and other thoughts about Fennel)
* Fennel Conf 2019

---

# Introduction
* me.jpg
* I'm Calvin (bakpakin)
* I like programming, especially languages and compilers.
* Computer Engineering Student at Boston University
* I wrote the original version of Fennel (called fnl)
* About 1000 lines of lua in 2016, has grown since

---

# My Fennel Experience
* I've spent a lot of time hacking on the compiler, a bit less time actually using it
* So I thought I would start "learning" Fennel for this talk.

---

# So lets make an HTTP server
* Fennel runs on Lua, Lua has lots of HTTP server libraries
* OpenResty, Luvit, Xavante, moonmint, Lapis, etc.
* We could simply use the Lua bindings directly

---

# ... But will they run on an ESP32?
* nice-pic.png
* 512 kB RAM
* 4M flash
* Doesn't run linux, can use FreeRTOS
* Bluetooth + Wifi peripherals
* ~$10 for a dev board
* System specific APIs for networking

---

# Use NodeMCU + Fennel for the board
* NodeMCU runs Lua, so it runs Fennel
* Use the Espressif libraries for C bindings
* Networking stack provided

---

# But the http package says (for client use only)
* nodemcu-doc-screenshot.png :(
* "Quote about not using nodeMCU for http server here."
* I do what I want.

---

# So I wrote my own HTTP parser. HTTP is pretty simple
* Line/text based protocol
* We don't need to handle the whole protocol - only what our server will handle

---

# NodeMCU net module
* Provides a way to listen on socket, run callback when packets arrive
* idea.png
* packets callback -> packet iterator
* packet iterator -> line iterator
* line-itertor -> http-parser

---

# The packet callback -> packet iterator
* Use coroutine.yield
* !!Show Code!!

---

# Packet iterator -> Line iterator
* In Clojure, we have lazy sequences, higher order functions like map, and transducers.
* In Fennel/Lua, we can use iterators. Our combinators can take in an iterator and return a new iterator
* CODE

---

# Line iterator -> HTTP parser
* We can now iterate over lines and be really stupid about parsing HTTP
* Code looks like blocking code, but isn't
* Use Lua Patterns for parsing HTTP syntax line by line.
* CODE

---

# Ring-like interface
* Our http parser creates a `req` table that we pass to a handler.
* Handler needs to return a response.
* CODE

---

# Response renderer
* Covert response object to HTTP response
* send the response over HTTP
* CODE

---

# That's pretty much it
* We have an HTTP server built on a raw tcp/ip stack
* We could swap out the original packet iterator for whatever we wanted (HTTP from pipe, netcat).
* Code is small enough to work on the ESP32/NodeMCU easily.

---

# Making it better
* Some duplication, lua style things
* Duh, write some macros (I want a `loop` macro)

---

# So why make a tiny HTTP server of software?
* Prototyping
* Illustration
* Learning
* Starting point for future projects.
* Fun!
* It's probably good enough, and all code is a liability

---

# "smol software"
* Distill something to it's roots
* You won't get everything right in the first take, maybe not in the first year either.
* When performance is not paramount, code can become A LOT shorter
* Other people can play with the code
* Simple > correct
* You spend more time thinking, less time writing code

---

# These are not new ideas
* Lisp, Smalltalk, etc.
* Suckless software
* Clojure (simple made easy)

---

# Simple software can be reused in unexpected ways
* Modify server to pipe from netcat
* Reuse line-iter function
* I use this technique in the Fennel parser

---

# For software toys, sometimes the idea is more important than the code
* npm micro modules -> github gists
* A lot of the code in Fennel has been rewritten (more than once!)
* It would have been a lot harder to rewrite if the design was less flexible

---

# Is Fennel still that small?
* Not totally, but we have some benefits of "smol software"
* One file, works with lots of different Lua distributions
* No build step for the compiler
* It's still fun to hack on!

---

# How can the Fennel compiler be improved?
* Distill some of the ideas in the compiler
* Simplify, simplify, simplify!
* Real usage and feedback
* Complexity = LOC * (Difficulty to use)

# Thanks!
